# Fable round queue — what is waiting on a ruling

**Written:** session 34 (2026-10-04), by Opus 5.5, at Venkat's request, after triaging
blygger-spec#11 (Aneesh Sathe's conformance toolkit and first-round report) and #12.
**Pruned:** session 38 (2026-10-06), Fable 5.1 — items 1–5 and 15 ruled (decisions
#59–#64, reasoning `v0.4-plan.md` §10), the seventh revision reviewed, the 0.27.0 styling
question ruled (#59). Numbers are kept so earlier references resolve.
**Added to:** session 48 (2026-10-13), Opus 5.5, at Venkat's request before a Fable round:
items 17–21, the roadmap rows marked *needs ruling* that are Fable's under #58, and decision
#69 in section C. Venkat asked for 17 by name and is holding its build for the ruling.
**Pruned:** session 49 (2026-10-17), Fable 5.1 — items 17, 19 and 21 ruled (decision #70,
the label; tangling no construct; item 21 confirmed as prompt-plus-strip, Opus builds);
section C's three entries reviewed and confirmed (#65, the G11 promotion, #69); the 0.4
document opened (#72). Items 18, 20 and 22 deliberately left for the next round.
**Pruned again:** session 49, second round (2026-10-17), Fable 5.1 — items 6–8, 10–11, 13,
15–16, 18 and 20 ruled (decisions #73–#77, reasoning `v0.4-plan.md` §12, text in the 0.4
second revision). **Only item 22 remains**, and Venkat is thinking about it before it is taken.
**Added to:** 2026-10-22 — item 14 unparked with per-hopper feeds (Aneesh Sathe; proposal PR).
**Read with** [`fable-brief.md`](fable-brief.md), which stays the standing agenda; this file
is the itemised queue for the next round. Delete an item once it is ruled; delete the file
when it is empty.

Each item says what it blocks, why it is Fable's under the four-question test (#58), and
where the evidence is. "Report F*n*" is finding *n* of
`conformance/reports/2026-10-03-first-round.html` in blygger-spec#11 (not merged as of
writing; read it on the PR branch — `gh api` with the URL quoted, zsh globs the `?`).

## A. Blocking — none

Items 1–5 were ruled in session 38: #60 (§9.2 vs #20), #61 (path-mounted verification
and withdrawn stubs, one test), #62 (#57 against F6, partiality from the bake), #63
(#43's third party). G11's promotion is unblocked.

## B. Needs a ruling, blocks no build

Items 6–8, 10–11, 13, 15–21 are ruled; numbers kept so references resolve.

6. *Ruled session 49 (#76): the re-check window closes when the origin stops serving the version; the promised check is the publisher's at publish. 0.4 §10.2.*
7. *Ruled session 49 (#76): the closure walks the baked versions. 0.4 §10.2.*
8. *Ruled session 49 (#76): the watermark survives withdrawal; the endcap is the highest version. 0.4 §13.4.*
9. *Decided session 38; #65, confirmed session 49.*
10. *Ruled session 49 (#76): member tables in §5 and §6.1, measured against all 22 live blygs.*
11. *Ruled session 49 (#76): LF or CRLF; CommonMark blockquote extent; one entry per directive; monotonic `stub_of.version`; local ids never fall through; no `stub_of` on an L0 wrapper id.*
12. *Declined session 38.*
13. *Ruled session 49 (#77): no wire member — a same-hash republish is maintenance (§13.2); `ignyr` is the studio's queue name; agent refreshes land there by construction.*
14. **Public hoppers: a feed per hopper, and the `hoppers` manifest key** (unparked
    2026-10-22, Aneesh Sathe; parked session 43 with the trigger "a second client, or
    blygger.com, asking to discover hoppers by machine"). The trigger came from a third
    direction: the World Machines blyg runs a bridge that wants to subscribe to members'
    public hoppers, not their whole blygs. Full write-up, with four questions and a
    resolution finding, in [`proposals/hopper-feeds-proposal.md`](proposals/hopper-feeds-proposal.md).
    Fable's under #58 on all three counts: a manifest key and a feed readers see (2), a
    reading of #12 and of §13.5's "no manifest vocabulary" (3), and resolution (§12.1)
    cannot reach a hopper feed today, because step 5 finds the blyg's own manifest first,
    so subscribing to one is a reader change (1). A draft studio PR builds the proposed
    shapes, off by default, so the ruling can be checked against code. The proposal PR
    also carries proposed text in `protocol-v0.4.md` (§2, §4, §6.1, §12.1 step 7,
    §12.2, §13.5, new §13.5a), marked PROPOSED in §17. Rule, edit or refuse before
    merging.
15. *Ruled session 49 (#73): RFC-3 with reference constants; `pinned_at` a ruled shape in §16.9.*
16. *Ruled session 49 (#73): a pin MAY re-send its mentions (§15.2).*
17. *Ruled session 49 (#70).*
18. *Ruled session 49 (#75): Pandoc attribute form, `width`/`height` only; §16.10.*
19. *Ruled session 49 with 17 (#70).*
20. *Ruled session 49 (#74): `cid` names the pinned document's bytes; §16.9.*
21. *Confirmed session 49.*
22. **An extension registry** (session 49, [studio#59](https://github.com/blygger/blygger-studio/pull/59),
    Aneesh Sathe, draft PR with a working implementation; `docs/extension-registry.md` on
    the branch lists its own open questions). A central `registry/index.json` that authors
    PR into and operators pull from with `npm run ext:add <name>`: each entry pins an https
    repo, a full commit and a sha256 tree hash, a supported studio range and
    `"server": false`; the pull runs on the operator's machine, and a studio never fetches
    from the registry at runtime (the `docs/extensions.md` rule holds). Fable's twice over:
    it compiles third-party code into the owner's session, and it proposes that
    blygger.org eventually host the index. To rule: whether a registry belongs to the
    program at all or to a third party; who reviews an entry, and what review promises;
    browser-only as a hard rule; and whether blygger.org hosts it. Session 49 told Aneesh
    to expect a ruling in a round or two, after 0.4 opens; 0.4 opened later that
    day, so this is the **next round's** first item.


## C. Review after the fact (#58 batch)

Nothing pending. Session 49 reviewed and confirmed #65 (§5.6 rules 7–8), the G11
promotion (§5.6 rule 6) and #69 (static front page; citation corrected to §8.4 rule 3,
sentence added to the 0.4 text) — `v0.4-plan.md` §11.1. Session 34's four studio calls
stand as noted in session 38.

## Not for Fable

- Report F11, F12, F15 and F16 were **done session 38** (Opus): the spec's tenth revision
  plus back-references on decisions #9, #14, #43 and a corrected section number in #22.
  **F13 is partly done:** the two rules it named as stated only in prose gained their MUST.
  The other ~56 keyword-less sentences need Aneesh's full list (`conformance/clauses/out/
  analysis.json`, gitignored; run `clauses/analyze.py` on the PR branch) and a pass that
  separates restatements from sole statements. Opus's, once #11 is merged.
- Report F10 (Webmention reach: 8 of 19 live blygs advertise an endpoint) works as
  specified. It is a registry or adoption question.
- Merging blygger-spec#11: Aneesh made all three review changes on 2026-10-04 (98af8da). It waits only on Venkat's `intents.json` correction pass.

## Optional

- **Unicode on the wire** (blygger-spec#6), the standing question in the brief. Take it
  deliberately or when a cross-client hash disagreement appears.

23. *Reassigned to Opus by Venkat, session 50 (2026-10-19): Opus drafts RFC-4, responding
    from anywhere (#82), from spec §16.11 and plan §14.4; Fable edits and rules it before
    it publishes, as RFC-3. Fable's part is the gate in `fable-brief.md`.*
